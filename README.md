# The SUMMA Platform: Scalable Understanding of Multilingual Media
This repository is the meta-repository for the SUMMA Platform in production mode.
Individual components are integrated as git submodules; in most cases, you won't need them,
as this repository relies on the summa platform docker registry at http://dockerhub.com/u/summaplatform.
In most cases, you won't have to initialize the submodules unless you want are a developer of that module.
